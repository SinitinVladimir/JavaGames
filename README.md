# Unusual Snake Game

## Introduction
This Java-based project transforms the classic Snake game into a multifaceted and engaging experience. By incorporating elements from other nostalgic games and quizzes, it aims to challenge players not only with traditional gameplay but also with questions on basic computer science (CS) concepts.

## Features
- **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Navigate the snake to eat apples and avoid crashing into itself or the game boundary.
- **Random Elements:** Special apples appear randomly that either pause the game to start a quiz on CS knowledge or switch gameplay to a Brick Breaker style game.
- **Brick Breaker Game:** A mini-game that can be triggered during the Snake game, featuring a paddle, ball, and bricks to be broken.
- **CS Quizzes:** Randomly appearing quiz apples that test the player's CS knowledge through multiple-choice questions.
- **Scoring System:** Points are earned by eating apples in the Snake game, breaking bricks in Brick Breaker, and correctly answering quiz questions.

## Future Enhancements
In future updates, I plan to expand the range of mini-games integrated into this project. Potential additions include:
- **Tic Tac Toe**
- **Pong**
- **Additional Snake Variants**
- **Tetris**
- **Space Invaders**
- **Frogger**
- **Asteroids**
- **Minesweeper**
- **Pac-Man**
- **Sokoban**
- **Simon Says**
- **Lunar Lander**
- **Arkanoid**
- **Pinball**
- **Flappy Bird**
- **Boulder Dash**
- **Bomberman**
- **Lemmings**
- **Tanks**

These games will be implemented to appear randomly, similar to the current special apple triggers, providing a varied and unpredictable gaming experience.

## Modules
1. **GamePanel.java**
   - Manages the main gameplay area, including game state, snake mechanics, and rendering of game elements.
2. **GameFrame.java**
   - Sets up the main game window and loads the `GamePanel`.
3. **BrickBreakerGame.java**
   - Controls the Brick Breaker game mechanics, such as the movement of the paddle and ball, and manages the game's UI.
4. **QuizGame.java**
   - Handles the quiz mechanics, including question generation, answer validation, and scoring.

## Installation
To run this project:
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Download the source code from this repository.
3. Compile the code using your preferred Java compiler or IDE.
4. Execute `GameFrame.java` to start the game.

## Usage
- Use the arrow keys to control the snake in the Snake game.
